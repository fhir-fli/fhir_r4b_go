	IssueType_Required = "required" // Required element missing: A required element is missing.
	IssueType_Value = "value" // Element value invalid: An element or header value is invalid.
	IssueType_Invariant = "invariant" // Validation rule failed: A content validation rule failed - e.g. a schematron rule.
	IssueType_Security = "security" // Security Problem: An authentication/authorization/permissions issue of some kind.

	IssueType_Not_supported = "not-supported" // Content not supported: The interaction, operation, resource or profile is not supported.
	IssueType_Duplicate = "duplicate" // Duplicate: An attempt was made to create a duplicate record.
	IssueType_Multiple_matches = "multiple-matches" // Multiple Matches: Multiple matching records were found when the operation required only one match.
	IssueType_Not_found = "not-found" // Not Found: The reference provided was not found. In a pure RESTful environment, this would be an HTTP 404 error, but this code may be used where the content is not found further into the application architecture.
	IssueType_Deleted = "deleted" // Deleted: The reference pointed to content (usually a resource) that has been deleted.
	IssueType_Too_long = "too-long" // Content Too Long: Provided content is too long (typically, this is a denial of service protection type of error).

	IssueType_Too_costly = "too-costly" // Operation Too Costly: The operation was stopped to protect server resources; e.g. a request for a value set expansion on all of SNOMED CT.
	IssueType_Business_rule = "business-rule" // Business Rule Violation: The content/operation failed to pass some business rule and so could not proceed.
	IssueType_Conflict = "conflict" // Edit Version Conflict: Content could not be accepted because of an edit conflict (i.e. version aware updates). (In a pure RESTful environment, this would be an HTTP 409 error, but this code may be used where the conflict is discovered further into the application architecture.).
	IssueType_Transient = "transient" // Transient Issue: Transient processing issues. The system receiving the message may be able to resubmit the same content once an underlying issue is resolved.
	IssueType_Lock_error = "lock-error" // Lock Error: A resource/record locking failure (usually in an underlying database).
	IssueType_No_store = "no-store" // No Store Available: The persistent store is unavailable; e.g. the database is down for maintenance or similar action, and the interaction or operation cannot be processed.
	IssueType_Exception = "exception" // Exception: An unexpected internal error has occurred.
	IssueType_Timeout = "timeout" // Timeout: An internal timeout has occurred.
	IssueType_Incomplete = "incomplete" // Incomplete Results: Not all data sources typically accessed could be reached or responded in time, so the returned information might not be complete (applies to search interactions and some operations).
	IssueType_Throttled = "throttled" // Throttled: The system is not prepared to handle this request due to load management.
	IssueType_Informational = "informational" // Informational Note: A message unrelated to the processing success of the completed operation (examples of the latter include things like reminders of password expiry, system maintenance times, etc.).
