// Code generated by FHIR Generator. DO NOT EDIT.
// This FHIR value set is comprised of Actor participation Type codes, which can be used to value FHIR agents, actors, and other role elements. The FHIR Actor participation type value set is based on DICOM Audit Message, C402; ASTM Standard, E1762-95 [2013]; selected codes and derived actor roles from HL7 RoleClass OID 2.16.840.1.113883.5.110; HL7 Role Code 2.16.840.1.113883.5.111, including AgentRoleType; HL7 ParticipationType OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.5.90; and HL7 ParticipationFunction codes OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.5.88. This value set includes, by reference, role codes from external code systems: NUCC Health Care Provider Taxonomy OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.6.101; North American Industry Classification System [NAICS]OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.6.85; IndustryClassificationSystem 2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.16039; and US Census Occupation Code OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.6.243 for relevant recipient or custodian codes not included in this value set.

	// Invasive lobular carcinoma: Invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk-producing glands (lobules) of the breast. Invasive cancer means the cancer cells have broken out of the lobule where they began and have the potential to spread to the lymph nodes and other areas of the body. Invasive lobular carcinoma typically doesn't form a lump, which is common in breast cancer. Instead, there is a change in the breast that feels like a thickening or fullness in one part of the breast and is different from the surrounding breast tissue.
