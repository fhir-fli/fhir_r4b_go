	ObjectLifecycleEvents_Transmit = "transmit" // Transmit Record Lifecycle Event: Occurs when an agent causes the system to send record entry content from one (EHR/PHR/other) system to another.
	ObjectLifecycleEvents_Unlink = "unlink" // Unlink Record Lifecycle Event: Occurs when an agent causes the system to disconnect two or more record entries previously connected, rendering them separate (disconnected) again.
