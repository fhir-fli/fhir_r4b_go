This cessation is anticipated to be permanent. The Change Description should describe the reason for cessation. Example uses: the medication in question is considered ineffective or has caused serious adverse effects. This value applies both to the cessation of a medication that is prescribed by another healthcare provider or patient self-administration of OTC medicines.
