	Language CommonLanguages `json:"language,omitempty"`

The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.

	// modifierExtension
	// May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants.

	// code
	// Code for an allergy or intolerance statement (either a positive or a negated/excluded statement).  This may be a code for a substance or pharmaceutical product that is considered to be responsible for the adverse reaction risk (e.g., "Latex"), an allergy or intolerance condition (e.g., "Latex allergy"), or a negated/excluded code for a specific substance or class (e.g., "No latex allergy") or a general or categorical negated statement (e.g.,  "No known allergy", "No known drug allergies").  Note: the substance for a specific reaction may be different from the substance identified as the cause of the risk, but it must be consistent with it. For instance, it may be a more specific substance (e.g. a brand medication) or a composite product that includes the identified substance. It must be clinically safe to only process the 'code' and ignore the 'reaction.substance'.  If a receiving system is unable to confirm that AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance falls within the semantic scope of AllergyIntolerance.code, then the receiving system should ignore AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance.
